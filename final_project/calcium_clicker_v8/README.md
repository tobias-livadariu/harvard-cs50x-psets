# CALCIUM CLICKER
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE> ::TODO
#### Description: This is an incremental web application inspired by other famous incremental web apps like "Cookie Clicker", "Swarm Simultor", and "Antimatter Dimensions". In Calcium Clicker, you play as a necromancer with the objective of building your army of undead skeletons as large, and strong, as possible. This is done in two ways. You can either click the "Dig Up More" button to manually dig up skeletons every click, or you can purchase autodiggers to automatically dig up skeletons 


#### Description: This is an incremental web application inspired by other famous incremental web apps like "Cookie Clicker", "Swarm Simultor", and "Antimatter Dimensions". In Calcium Clicker, you play as a necromancer, and the objective is to build your army of skeletons and other undead as large, and strong, as possible. In the game, you can create seperate armies or "legions", each having their own "power rating" depending on the type and count of units in the army. Unlike the other incremental web apps that have come before it, "Calcim Clicker" aims to be fundementally different by introducing an element of chance. Instead of just seeing numbers eternally grow faster and faster, units in your armies can actually be killed in battle. This is determined by a hypergeometric discrete probability distribution taking in account the power level of your army, and the enemy army that it is fighting. If units survive long enough in your armies, and kill enough foes (meaning they pass enough hypergeometric distribution checks), they gain experience points (xp). Units that have gained enough xp points will become "hardened" and can be evolved into stronger versions of themselves. Note that every interaction in the game, be it recruiting more units, fighting battles, or evolving units, takes real world time. The aim of this is to take away from the "clicker" aspect, increasing the focus on strategy and resource management (or time management in this case). Note that some routes and functions, such as the register and login routes, were taken from week 9's Finance pset. The users table in Calcium Clicker's sqlite3 database was also taken from the table in Finance of the same name.
TODO: Finish the description, making it more polished and including more aspects of the game. Also, complete the rest of the README using proper markup syntax for github after the project has been completed.
