# CALCIUM CLICKER
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE> ::TODO
#### Description:
This is an incremental web application inspired by other famous incremental web apps like "Cookie Clicker", "Swarm Simultor", and "Antimatter Dimensions". In Calcium Clicker, you play as a necromancer with the objective of building your army of undead skeletons as large, and strong, as possible. This is done in two ways. The user can either click the "Dig Up More" button to manually dig up skeletons every click, or they can purchase autodiggers to automatically dig up skeletons for them. Each autodigger digs up one skeleton per second, with multiple autodiggers stacking to produce very fast gains once the user buys a large number of them. The number of skeletons the user gets per click can be increased by upgrading their shovel to higher tiers, with higher tiers of shovel generating exponentially more skeletons per click, but also costing exponentially more skeletons to buy.

The user gains the ability to buy autodiggers and to upgrade their shovel when their total skeleton count reaches 10. This will trigger the page to refresh through the refreshPage() javascript function, and generate more elements on the screen. When buying autodiggers, the user has a choice between buying one, buying ten, or buying the maximum amount that they can currently afford. This was implemented through javascript and two flask routes, one that gets the number of autodiggers the user is currently able to afford, and another that purchases the autodiggers. If the user decides to only buy one autodigger, only the route that purchases autodiggers will run, and after fetching the user's current skeleton count and cost of next autodigger from the web app's SQL database, it will make the transaction and update the database values. If the user decides to buy multiple autodiggers, first the route that determines how many autodiggers the user can afford is run, which then passes values to the route that buys autodiggers, causing it to run slightly differently and buy multiple autodiggers depending on the values that the first route passed to it. In either scenario, the DOM is then updated through asyncronous JavaScript to display the next autodigger count. When upgrading their shovel, the user clicks a button on the scren that calls the buyShovel() javascript function. This function will fetch 

#### Description: This is an incremental web application inspired by other famous incremental web apps like "Cookie Clicker", "Swarm Simultor", and "Antimatter Dimensions". In Calcium Clicker, you play as a necromancer, and the objective is to build your army of skeletons and other undead as large, and strong, as possible. In the game, you can create seperate armies or "legions", each having their own "power rating" depending on the type and count of units in the army. Unlike the other incremental web apps that have come before it, "Calcim Clicker" aims to be fundementally different by introducing an element of chance. Instead of just seeing numbers eternally grow faster and faster, units in your armies can actually be killed in battle. This is determined by a hypergeometric discrete probability distribution taking in account the power level of your army, and the enemy army that it is fighting. If units survive long enough in your armies, and kill enough foes (meaning they pass enough hypergeometric distribution checks), they gain experience points (xp). Units that have gained enough xp points will become "hardened" and can be evolved into stronger versions of themselves. Note that every interaction in the game, be it recruiting more units, fighting battles, or evolving units, takes real world time. The aim of this is to take away from the "clicker" aspect, increasing the focus on strategy and resource management (or time management in this case). Note that some routes and functions, such as the register and login routes, were taken from week 9's Finance pset. The users table in Calcium Clicker's sqlite3 database was also taken from the table in Finance of the same name.
TODO: Finish the description, making it more polished and including more aspects of the game. Also, complete the rest of the README using proper markup syntax for github after the project has been completed.
