/* I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.
Earlier this morning, before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief there withdrawing some money. */
/* As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less than a minute.
In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest flight out of Fiftyville tomorrow.
The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket. */

-- (adding one extra minute to be safe).
-- They were also seen withdrawing money from an ATM on Legget Street earlier that morning.

-- Also, the theif flew out of the country the next day ON THE EARLIEST FLIGHT, so I need to look for plane tickets
-- on the day of July 29, 2023.

-- Finally, the theif's accomplice bought the ticket, so I need to see who bought a ticket on either
-- July 29, 2023 or July 28, 2023 for a flight on July 29, 2023 to find the accomplice.

-- To find all possible liscence plates of the theif, I will have to further analyze the bakery's
