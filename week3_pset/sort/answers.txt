sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: As the size of the integer array being sorted increases, the time taken for sort1 to sort the array increases exponentially.
To sort random10000, sort1 took on average around 0.246 seconds. However, to sort random50000, sort1 took on average around 5.598 seconds.
This rapid and extreme increase in sorting times indicates that the algorithm used by sort1 is on the order of n^2, so sort1 uses either
bubble or selection sort. However, sort1 took on average around 0.435 seconds to sort sorted50000. This indicates that sort1's o-value
is significantly larger than its omega-value. Since selection sort's o-value and omega-value are equal, the vast difference between
sort1's o-values and omega-values indicates that sort1 uses bubble sort.

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: As the size of the integer array being sorted increases, the time taken for sort2 to sort the array increases exponentially
slower when compared to the other two programs. This 

sort3 uses: selection sort
